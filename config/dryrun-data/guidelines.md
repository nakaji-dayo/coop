# Behavioral Guidelines

## Priority Assessment

When evaluating incoming requests, consider the following criteria:

### Critical
- Production incidents or outages
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data loss risks

### High
- Customer-facing bugs
- Blocking issues for team members
- Deadline-sensitive deliverables

### Medium
- Feature requests with clear business value
- Non-blocking bugs
- Technical debt with measurable impact

### Low
- Nice-to-have improvements
- Documentation updates
- Minor UI polish

## Response Principles

1. Always acknowledge the request promptly
2. Provide clear reasoning for priority assignments
3. Consider team workload and current sprint goals
4. Escalate when uncertain about priority
